      WHATS 1: Description: We deliver our fine tuned Problem Solving workshop
      as as educational team building experience. Although this course was
      designed for the workplace it is well suited for any event where up to 20
      people work together to open their minds.


      One of our experts will come to you and run an hour and a half session in
      which a series of exercises and tests that will make a team think. What
      they learn as a group will translate to their own very intricately
      different puzzles.


      Every participant leaves not only awakened to their own ability to step
      closer to the impossible, but carrying a Silent Cow training kit that will
      allow them to easily complete our 5 level cube solving tutorials.

      WHATS 2: Description: Learn how to speed cube with the 5 level training
      programme!


      Our philosophy is to engage your muscle memory from the start of your
      cubing journey which means you will learn fast, improve fast and
      ultimately solve fast.


      As the training videos progress - REWIND, PRACTICE, PAUSE and PLAY at your
      own pace to let the method settle in your head and hands. Earn your
      stickers and put them on your box when you are ready to move forward.


      Its sensible to do this course over a couple of weeks that way your hands
      will retain what you have learned and you will be able to solve reliably
      for years to come!
