      building experience. Although this course was designed for the workplace
      it is well suited for any event where up to 20 people work together to
      open their minds.


      One of our experts will come to you and run an hour and a half session in
      which a series of exercises and tests that will make a team think. What
      they learn as a group will translate to their own very intricately
      different puzzles.

      closer to the impossible, but carrying a Silent Cow training kit that will
      allow them to easily complete our 5 level cube solving tutorials.
