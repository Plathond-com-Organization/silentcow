    quote: >-
      Some problems in life appear too complex to attempt and the cube has
      become the very image of this fear. We are here to show you that your
      brain can break down almost any problem - and this is just the
      beginning.....

    quote: >-
      The solution to many problem is just a factor of your own ability to spot
      the solution. If you think that solving cubes at speed is about memorising
      algorithms - then I am afraid you have been misinformed.


      Once you have the skills to unpick a problem - that's when you can
      construct a solution.
